      institution: Department of Environmental Sciences, Computer Science and Statistics, Ca' Foscari University of Venice
      year: May 2022 – today
      description: Due to my activity in computer security, I am partially affilated to Ca' Foscari University of Venice, in order to participate to the <a href="https://serics.eu/services/spoke-6-sicurezza-software-piattaforme/">Spoke 6 <em>Software and Platform Security</em></a> of SERICS. The aim of this spoke's research is to provide an ecosystem where software developers can easily reason about software security, thanks to innovative security-aware programming abstractions and new semantic models.

      institution: INFN (National Institute of Nuclear Physics), Trieste
      year: Jan 1999 – Jun 2000
      description: >
        I was involved in the creation of the <a href="https://jhep.sissa.it">Journal of High Energy Physics</a> (JHEP), the <em>ante litteram</em> open access journal for theoretical physics. It was a quite applicative position focused on design and implementation of a real distribured, fault-tolerant, scalable system. During these years I hadn't carried out much research, but I learnt a lot about real distributed systems: I had to face the dire consequences of the CAP theorem, well before it was proved!
