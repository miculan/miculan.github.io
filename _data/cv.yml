      year: Jan 1999 – Jun 2000
      description: >
        I was involved in the creation of the <a href="https://jhep.sissa.it">Journal of High Energy Physics</a> (JHEP), the <em>ante litteram</em> open access journal for theoretical physics. It was a quite applicative position focused on design and implementation of a real distribured, fault-tolerant, scalable system. During these years I hadn't carried out much research, but I learnt a lot about real distributed systems: I had to face the dire consequences of the CAP theorem, well before it was proved!
