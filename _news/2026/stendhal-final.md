    PRIN 2022 "STENDHAL" Final meeting, at DMIF, University of Udine
---
On January 22-23 we host the workshop **“Intelligenza artificiale in medicina, esperienze a confronto.”** The event showcases how our region is becoming a hub for "Health Tech" by bridging the gap between high-level research and hospital operations.

* Through the PRIN 2022 **Stendhal Project**, we are developing "Hybrid AI" that provides accurate, transparent brain image analysis—essential for diagnostic trust.
* Our work aligns with major initiatives like **Horizon IMI BigPicture**, the largest European pathology database, and the **Bosomshield** project for cancer prediction.
* Inspired by **DCR Graphs** research, we explore how Hybrid AI can create more accurate chatbots and agile digital workflows in healthcare.
* In collaboration with **ASUFC**, we highlighted AI’s transition into real-world use—from optimizing waiting lists to supporting emergency radiology.

Moving from experimentation to daily operations, ensuring that technology serves both the clinician and the patient through better governance and safety.
