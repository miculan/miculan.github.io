title: Welcome to Gabriele Tam, new PhD student!
---
We are pleased to announce that Gabriele Tam has joined our group as student of the [PhD Program in Informatics and Artificial Intelligence](https://dmif.uniud.it/it/didattica/dottorato/iai/phd-course-in-computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence).

Gabriele’s doctoral research investigates anomaly detection and security protocols for real-time networks within the railway sector. Given the mission-critical nature of modern train systems, his work addresses the stringent timing and speed requirements where latency is not an option.

This research project is supported by a strategic partnership with [Cleverynext](https://cleverynext.com), specializing in the design of high-performance network devices for rail applications. We are excited to support Gabriele as he develops solutions for these rapidly evolving fields!
