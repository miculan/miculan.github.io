The Ca' Foscari University of Venice has opened two 3-years research positions ("assistant professor", RTD/A) within the PNRR project “SERICS” (possibly, in collaboration with our research group in Udine).

The research topics can be the following:
- *Software and Platform Security*: secure programming, formal methods of security, secure compilation, software supply chain security, API-level analysis, protection and obfuscation techniques, etc.
- *Misinformation and Fakes*: techniques to tackle the problem of Information Disorder.
- *Attacks and Defences*: Foundations of AI security, security of AI-based tools.

Hence, if you are an aspiring talented young scientist, interested in any of these topics (and particularly in ), please apply before the deadline: **24 August 2023, 13:00 CEST**. More informations on the [Ca' Foscary web site](https://www.unive.it/data/38002/?id=2023-UNVE000-0180957).

Personally, I am eager to collaborate on *Software and Platform Security*, which is the topic I am (partly) affiliated to the University of Venice for. Hence, if you are interested, and have any question, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:marino.miculan@uniud.it).
