With the excellent results of the latest competitions, the [MadrHacks](https://ctftime.org/team/114509), the ethical hacking team of the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it), has jumped to the top of the national ranking on CTFtime - and 23rd worldwide, over more than 21600 teams (i.e., we are almost within the top 0.1%).

This success is not a coincidence but the result of a long-term team building project, started over three years ago. Their success has been made possible thanks to exceptional teamwork and the individual dedication of each member. Each member brings specific skills, ranging from vulnerability analysis to cryptography, network management to OSINT. Through open communication and an atmosphere of mutual trust, the team is able to maximize individual abilities and create innovative solutions for the challenges they face.

Another crucial element of this team success is continuous research and education. The world of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, with new threats constantly emerging. That's why at the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it), we have established an p[International Master Degree in AI & CS](https://www.dmif.uniud.it/en/master/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity/), and starting next year, also a path within the national [Master Degree in Computer Science](https://www.dmif.uniud.it/en/master/computer-science/cybersecurity/). Moreover, we have a research unit about Cybersecurity (which is the local node of the [Cybersecurity National Lab](https://cybersecnatlab.it)), with collaborations with important companies like [beanTech](https://www.beantech.it) and [Danieli Automation DIGI&MET](https://www.dca.it).

Because what we do for fun today will be a successful profession tomorrow.
