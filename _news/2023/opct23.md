title: Attending the OPCT 2023 Research Seminar
---
This week I am attending the [Open Problems in Concurrency Theory (OPCT) 2023](http://www.sti.uniurb.it/events/opct2023/index.html) research seminar, held in the medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro, Italy (9 years after my first OPCT).

OPCT, sponsored by the [IFIP Working Group 1.8](https://concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip), serves as a platform for identifying important open problems in the field of concurrency theory and sharing ongoing studies. To this end, OPCT brings together researchers, scholars, and enthusiasts in the concurrency theory community, fostering knowledge exchange and promoting intellectual growth. 

During the seminar, I have the privilege of giving an invited talk on "Modeling Collective Adaptive Systems with Attribute-Based Events: Recent Trends and Open Problems". The [slides are available here](/assets/pdf/OPCT23-slides.pdf).
It is a exceptional opportunity for me to engage with experts and contribute to the ongoing discussions in the field.
And it is nice to meet again so many friends!
