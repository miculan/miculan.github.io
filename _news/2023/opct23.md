title: Presenting on AbU and Collective Adaptive Systems at OPCT 2023, Bertinoro
---
This week I will be attending the [Open Problems in Concurrency Theory (OPCT) 2023](http://www.sti.uniurb.it/events/opct2023/index.html) research seminar, held in the medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro, Italy.

OPCT, sponsored by the [IFIP Working Group 1.8](https://concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip), serves as a platform for identifying important open problems in the field of concurrency theory and sharing ongoing studies. 
During the seminar, I have the privilege of giving an invited presentation on "Modeling Collective Adaptive Systems with Attribute-Based Events: Recent Trends and Open Problems."

OPCT brings together researchers, scholars, and enthusiasts in the concurrency theory community, fostering knowledge exchange and promoting intellectual growth. It is a valuable opportunity for me to engage with experts and contribute to the ongoing discussions in the field.
And it is nice to meet again so many friends!
