Today I have participated to the radio show *Gjal e copasse* on [Radio Spazio](http://www.radiospazio103.it), a free radio in Udine mostly oriented to [Friulian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friulian_language)-speaking people. On the occasion of the [Digital Security Festival](https://www.digitalsecurityfestival.it), we have discussed about cybersecurity issues, solutions and research projects at the University of Udine.
If you are curious about *sigurece informatiche* in Friulian, the [recording is available](https://www.spreaker.com/user/15743104/gjal-20231027) on Spreaker.
