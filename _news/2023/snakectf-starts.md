This weekend (Dec 8-9, 2023), [MadrHacks](https://madrhacks.org), the ethical hacking team of the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it), will organize the first edition of the [snakeCTF](https://2023.snakectf.org), a team-based jeopardy-style CTF.  I can tell you that the challenges will be quite… original! 😉

So, what are you waiting for? [Register for the snakeCTF](https://2023.snakectf.org/register) now!
