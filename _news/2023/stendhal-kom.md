   PRIN 2022 "STENDHAL" Kickoff meeting, at Dept. Computer Science, University of Pisa
---
Today I am attending the kickoff meeting of the "project of national interest" (PRIN 2022) STENDHAL ("Spatio-Temporal Enhancement of Neural Nets for Deeply Hierarchical Automatised Logic"), which runs from Octomber 2023 to September 2025. The meeting is hosted at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Pisa.
About 20 participants from the three research units (University of Pisa, University of Udine and ISTI-CNR) attend the meeting. 

STENDHAL will push the boundaries of spatial analysis by introducing spatio-temporal capabilities in sequences of images. This breakthrough will enable advanced analysis of time series of graph-like data, such as in cyber-physical systems and in longitudinal studies in healthcare, empowering researchers and practitioners to extract valuable insights from visual data.
The project will pioneer the integration of spatial model checking with neural networks. By combining the precision of neural networks with expert-driven monitoring of requirements, such as protocols, guidelines, and safety properties, we aim to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and efficiency in complex systems.
STENDHAL's innovative methods will be rigorously validated through case studies in the healthcare and cyber-physical domains. These real-world applications will demonstrate the practical implications of our research, showcasing the great potential for enhancing decision-making, safety, and performance in critical domains.

We are now preparing to hire dedicated researchers - so, stay tuned for further updates as we finalize the recruitment process, and prepare to embark on this research journey!
