I am attending the [24rd Italian Conference on Theoretical Computer Science (ICTCS 2023)](https://ictcs2023.unipa.it) - which, despite the name, has many contributions from abroad. Nice to meet with many friends.

Matteo Paier presents our paper [Assembling coherent network topologies using round-trip graphs](https://ictcs2023.unipa.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ICTCS2023_PAPER_6692.pdf).
