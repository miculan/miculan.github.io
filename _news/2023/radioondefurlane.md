Today I have participated to the radio show *La Universit창t dal Fri청l tal teritori* on Radio Onde Furlane, a free radio in Udine mostly oriented to [Friulian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friulian_language)-speaking people. Together with colleagues Gian Luca Foresti and Federico Costantini, we have discussed about cybersecurity issues, solutions and research projects at UniUD. 
If you are curious about *sigurece informatiche* in Friulian, the [recording is available](https://www.spreaker.com/user/ondefurlane/universitat-dal-friul-tal-teritori-07) on Spreaker.
