title: Talk about "Bigraphical models for Container-based Systems" at DI, UniPI
---
Today I have given a talk about _Bigraphical models for Container-based Systems_, within the [2023 Hot topics in Language-Based security Seminar Series](http://pages.di.unipi.it/bodei/HTLBS.html) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.unipi.it) of the University of Pisa. The [slides are available here](/assets/pdf/2023-HTLBS-UniPI.pdf).

It is always a pleasure to come back to my _alma mater_, and to meet so many friends!
