title: Attending (and giving a talk at) "SERICS SPOKE 6 First Software and Platform Security Workshop"
---
Today I am attending the [First Software and Platform Security Workshop](https://www.dsi.unive.it/~focardi/workshopSERICS2023.pdf) of the SPOKE 6 of SERICS, at the DAIS, Caâ€™ Foscari University of Venice. This is an important milestone for the projects of this spoke, namely SWOPS and SCAI. 
I give a talk about *Compositional models for Container-based Systems*. The [slides are available here](/assets/pdf/2023-SPOKE6.pdf).
