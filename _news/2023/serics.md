Today the project [SERICS (SEcurity and RIghts in the CyberSpace)](https://www.cybersecurity360.it/news/progetto-serics-sostenere-la-ricerca-in-cyber-security-per-irrobustire-il-sistema-paese/) begins! 

SERICS is one of the [14 parterships selected by the Ministry](https://www.mur.gov.it/it/news/mercoledi-03082022/pnrr-mur-selezionati-i-14-partenariati-attivita-di-ricerca) for advanced research within the PNRR.
In particular, SERICS has been selected for the thematic *Cybersecurity, new technologies and rights protection*.

I participate to this project as member of the spoke *Software and Platform Security*, based at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice.  

And we have a *lot* of work to do! Soon we will open new positions (research fellowships, PhD, and alike), so, if you are interested in working on advanced cybersecurity topics, stay tuned and get in touch!
