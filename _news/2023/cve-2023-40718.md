title: FortiOS - IPS Engine evasion using custom TCP flags (CVE-2023-40718)

With a fruitful collaboration with the DISO of the University of Udine, about one year ago we discovered a vulnerability in several Fortigate firewalls: an attacker could evade IPS features via crafted TCP packets. That is: by carefully setting some bits, TCP packets can pass through the firewall, despite the rules.

We promptly signaled the vulnerability to Fortinet, and finally, the vulnerability has been published as [CVE-2023-40718](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40718).
