I have a 1-year research fellow position available, to work about the formalisation and analysis of workflows. Something about BPMN, deadlock avoidance, resource assessment, and the alike. But it is quite flexible.

Requirements: MSc in Computer Science or equivalent. PhD preferred (but not required).
Location: theoretically in Udine, but we can deal also with remote working. 

More details on the [official UniUd website](https://www.uniud.it/it/albo-ufficiale), entry 1675 ("decreto rettorale n. 1564").

Deadline for applications is January 26, 2023 14:00 CET.<br/>
If you are interested, or have any questions, don't hesitate to [write me](mailto:marino.miculan@uniud.it).
