On Monday, October 23, I will participate to the Round Table [Rischi, opportunit√† e futuro della cybersecurity](https://www.digitalsecurityfestival.it/edizione-2023/programma/giorno-04) at the [Digital Security Festival](https://www.digitalsecurityfestival.it/).  This large event is accredited in the European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM), the European Union campaign to promote awareness among citizens of cyber threats and methods to counter them, to change their perception of cyber threats and provide updated information on the subject of cyber protection and information security. The ECSM is organized by the European agency ENISA.
