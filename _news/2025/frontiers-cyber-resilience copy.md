Honored to have participated to the seminar "Frontiers of Cyber-resilience: Between Safety and Security" today, organized by the Department of Law. Thanks [Federico Costantini](https://people.uniud.it/page/federico.costantini) for the kind invitation. The slides of my presentation are [available here](/assets/pdf/2025-frontiereresilienza.pdf). 

The event, designed for "Digital Security Law" students and open to legal professionals, explored the evolving landscape of emergency and incident management in information security, cybersecurity, and cyber-resilience. We discussed the redefinition of key concepts, principles, methodologies, and organizational models crucial for enhancing adaptability, proactivity, and collaboration among stakeholders.
