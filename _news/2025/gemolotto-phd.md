---
We are delighted to announce that [Luca Gemolotto](https://lucagemolotto.github.io/) has joined our research group as student of the [PhD Program in Informatics and Artificial Intelligence](https://dmif.uniud.it/it/didattica/dottorato/iai/phd-course-in-computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence).

Luca’s research is focused on the critical intersection of modern computing and complex automation. His interests include Programming Languages and their application in novel systems, Distributed Systems for scalable computing solutions, and in particular Multi-Domain Robotic Coordination, a key area for future autonomous systems. 

We are excited to support Luca's journey and see the impact of his work on these rapidly evolving fields.
