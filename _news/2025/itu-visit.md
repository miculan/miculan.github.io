On December 8-10 I am visiting the [Theoretical Computer Science](https://en.itu.dk/Research/Research-Sections/Theoretical-Computer-Science) section and the [Center for Information Security and Trust (CISAT)](https://cisat.dk/) at the IT University of Copenhagen, where I will give a talk about "Towards a Formally Verified Language for Stateful Authorization Policies".
