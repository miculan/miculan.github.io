Honored to have participated in the seminar "Frontiers of Cyber-resilience: Between Safety and Security" today, organized by the Department of Law. Thanks [Federico Costantini](https://people.uniud.it/page/federico.costantini) for the kind invitation.

The event, designed for "Digital Security Law" students and open to legal professionals, explored the evolving landscape of emergency and incident management in information security, cybersecurity, and cyber-resilience. We discussed the redefinition of key concepts, principles, methodologies, and organizational models crucial for enhancing adaptability, proactivity, and collaboration among stakeholders.
