Today I have participated to the radio program _[What a wonderful world](https://www.raiplaysound.it/programmi/whatawonderfulworld)_ on [Rai-Radio per il Friuli-Venezia Giulia](http://www.sedefvg.rai.it/). On the occasion of the [snakeCTF finales](https://snakectf.org), we have discussed about cybersecurity issues, solutions and teaching initiatives at the University of Udine. The recording is [available on Raiplaysound]().
