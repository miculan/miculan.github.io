From June 26th to 28th I am attending the [Second Software and Platform Security Workshop](https://www.dsi.unive.it/~focardi/SecondSPOKE6workshop.pdf) of the SERICS project, at the Caâ€™ Foscari University of Venice, where I will talk about [Attribute-based Communication over Pub/Sub: Transactional Coordination for Smart Systems](/assets/pdf/2025-SERICS-Spoke6.pdf).
