Thrilled to be a speaker at the [27th Estonian Winter School in Computer Science (EWSCS 2025)](https://cs.ioc.ee/ewscs/2025/)!  This event will be held in the fishing (actually, [artistic](https://www.viinistu.ee/en/museum)) village of Viinistu, northern Estonia, 3-6 March 2025.
More details about my course, with slides, [are here](https://cs.ioc.ee/ewscs/2025/lecturer_details.php?lc=miculan).
It is always exciting discussing with students and fellow researchers!
