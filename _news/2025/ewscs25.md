Thrilled to be a speaker at the [27th Estonian Winter School in Computer Science (EWSCS 2025)](https://cs.ioc.ee/ewscs/2025/)!  This event will be held in the fishing village of Viinistu, northern Estonia, 3-6 March 2025.
It is always exciting discussing about cybersecurity with students and fellow researchers!
