I am attending the [13th International Symposium On Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation (ISoLA 2024)](https://2024-isola.isola-conference.org) from 26 to 31 October. I'll be presenting [Local Reasoning and Attribute-based Memory Updates for Enforcing Global Invariants in Collective Adaptive Systems](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-75107-3_21) in the _Rigorous Engineering of Collective Adaptive Systems_ (REoCAS) track.
