Outshining about 20 teams from renowned universities (see the ranking [here](https://cybercup.it/scoreboard.html)), the MadrHacks team showcased their expertise and preparedness in the competition. The success has been marked by the awarding of the trophy in Turin on July 5th, in occasion of the National Finals of [CyberChallenge.it 2024](https://cyberchallenge.it).
