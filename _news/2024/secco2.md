    Talk about DBCChecker at "Cloud Security Awareness Days", Rome
---
Today I give an invited talk about "DBCChecker: Formally Verifying Security Properties of Containers Compositions" at the [5G and Cloud Security Awareness Days](https://www.cnit.it/en/2024/06/12/workshop-5g-and-cloud-security-awareness-days-19-20-june-rome/), organized by SERICS Spoke 4 at the Centro Congressi Cavour, Rome. 
The [slides are available here](/assets/pdf/2024-SECCO2.pdf).

[SERICS Spoke 4](https://serics.eu/en/services/spoke-4-sicurezza-sistemi-operativi-virtualizzazione/) is concerned with developing high-level automated security services and innovative security assessment and assurance methodologies to support the secure-by-design development and verification of cloud, edge, and 5G applications.
So maybe our bigraph-based models and tools for reasoning about container compositions could be useful to this end!
