    Talk about "Enforcing Global Invariants with Local Reasoning in AbU CAS" at SWOPS2, Lucca
---
Today I give a talk about "Enforcing Global Invariantswith Local Reasoning in AbU Collective Adaptive Systems" at the [Second Workshop of the "Secure Software From First Principles" (SWOPS) project](https://www.imtlucca.it/it/eventonew/second-secure-software-from-first-principles-workshop-del-progetto-serics-spoke-6), hosted by [IMT Scuola Alti Studi](https://www.imtlucca.it), Lucca. 
The [slides are available here](/assets/pdf/2024-SWOPS2.pdf).

[SWOPS](https://serics.eu/en/services/spoke-6-sicurezza-software-piattaforme/) is a NGEU NRRP-funded project of PE7 SERICS. This project aims to develop semantic models and high-level programming abstractions for writing secure code from the first principle, to devise techniques to analyze a piece of software both at a static time and at run-time in order to assess its security properties continuously and to ensure that is free from vulnerabilities.
