   PRIN 2022 "STENDHAL" First Year meeting
---
Today I am attending the first year meeting of the "project of national interest" (PRIN 2022) STENDHAL ("Spatio-Temporal Enhancement of Neural Nets for Deeply Hierarchical Automatised Logic"), which runs from October 2023 to September 2025. The meeting is hosted by the Department of Computer Science of the University of Pisa.
About 20 participants from the three research units (University of Pisa, University of Udine and ISTI-CNR) attend the meeting.
