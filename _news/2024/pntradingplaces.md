Today I was honored to participate in the panel _Cyber Risk in Financial Systems_, as part of the scientific conference _Informatization and Financial Services: Cyber Risk and Artificial Intelligence_. The event, aimed at students of Banking and Finance and industry professionals, provided an important opportunity to delve deeper into the challenges posed by cybersecurity in the increasingly digitalized financial world.
Tomorrow evening, I will have the pleasure of addressing a wider audience at the conference _Cyber Risk for Users of Financial Services_.

Both events are within [PN Trading Places](https://qui.uniud.it/ateneo/educazione-finanziaria-per-tutte-le-eta-al-via-il-festival-pn-trading-places/), a financial education festival held in Pordenone since 2021. Organized by the University of Udine and the Municipality of Pordenone, the event aims to contribute to promoting a widespread financial culture for all ages and levels. And clearly, it is important to raise awareness among a diverse audience about the importance of cybersecurity and promote a culture of personal data protection, especially in the financial area.
