Today, I had the opportunity to present the potential of blockchain for food traceability at the workshop ["La Blockchain nelle filiere alimentari: il caso della Carne Pezzata Rossa Italiana"](https://magredierisorgivefvg.eu/3workshop/)
("Blockchain in Food Supply Chains: the case of Pezzata Rossa Italiana") at the Experimental Farm "F. Ricchieri" (Fiume Veneto, PN). This is the fourth public event of the [Gra.MA.R. Project](https://magredierisorgivefvg.eu).

In my talk ["L’applicazione della tecnologia della blockchain per la tracciabilità nelle filiere agroalimentari"](/assets/pdf/FiumeVeneto-slides.pdf) I illustrated how this technology, through the creation of an immutable and decentralized digital ledger, allows for tracking every stage of the supply chain, from farm to table. And I have learned a lot from other speakers' talks!
