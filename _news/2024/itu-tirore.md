title: Visit and PhD Committee at IT University of Copenhagen
---
From today to December 12, I am visiting the [Programming, Logic and Semantics](https://pls.itu.dk/) group at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk/).   
Tomorrow I will give a talk about _A bigraph-based Formal Model and Verification Framework for Container-Based Systems_; the [slides are here](/assets/pdf/2024-ITU.pdf).   
On Thursday I am honored to serve on [Dawit Tirore](https://tirore96.github.io/)'s [PhD Final Evaluation Committee](https://en.itu.dk/Research/PhD-Programme/PhD-Defences/PhD-Defences-2024/December/Dawit-Tirore).  
It is always a pleasure to come back to Copenhagen!
