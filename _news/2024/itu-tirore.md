title: Visit and PhD Committee at IT University of Copenhagen
---
From today to December 12, I am visiting the [Programming, Logic and Semantics](https://pls.itu.dk/) group at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk/).   
Tomorrow I will give a talk about _A bigraph-based Formal Model and Verification Framework for Container-Based Systems_ at [CISAT](https://cisat.dk).  
On Thursday I am honored to serve on [Dawit Tirore](https://tirore96.github.io/)'s PhD Final Evaluation Committee.  
It is always a pleasure to come back to Copenhagen!
