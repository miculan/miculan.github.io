Thrilled to be selected as the representative speaker for [Spoke 4](https://serics.eu/en/services/spoke-4-sicurezza-sistemi-operativi-virtualizzazione/) of SERICS at the upcoming [NECS 2025 PhD Winter School](https://necs-winterschool.disi.unitn.it/)!  This exciting event will be held in the wonderful mountain resort town of Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from January 20th to 24th, 2025.  
I look forward to discussing cybersecurity threats with students and fellow researchers!
