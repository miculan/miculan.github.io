title: Attending the Theory Days 2024 Research Seminar
---
I am attending the [35th Estonian and 9th Joint Estonian-Latvian Theory Days](https://cs.ioc.ee/lsg/tdays/tday-randivalja/) research seminar, held in Randivälja village, Pärnu county, Estonia.

During the seminar, I have the privilege of giving an invited talk on "An attribute-based events model for collective adaptive systems". The [slides are available here](/assets/pdf/TheoryDays24-slides.pdf).
It is nice to meet again so many friends!
