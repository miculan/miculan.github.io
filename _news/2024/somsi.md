I had the pleasure of presenting at [Maggio Scienza 2024](https://www.comune.cividale-del-friuli.ud.it/it/maggio-scienza-2024-80651) in Cividale del Friuli, a conference exploring the theme of "Artificial Intelligence: Navigating Challenges and Embracing Opportunities." My talk focused on "Cybersecurity: Artificial Intelligence as an Ally in the Fight Against Hackers" (in italian: "Sicurezza informatica: lâ€™Intelligenza Artificiale come alleata nella lotta contro gli hacker"), where I have presented some recent results achieved at our University in this directions.
