title: Our research group welcomes categorical logic expert Matteo Spadetto
---
We are happy to announce that [Matteo Spadetto](https://spadetto.github.io/), a PhD student specializing in categorical logic and homotopy type theory, will be joining our research group.

Matteo comes from the University of Leeds (UK) where he is currently completing his PhD under the supervision of Nicola Gambino, Federico Olimpieri, and Michael Rathjen. His prior studies in pure mathematics at the University of Trento (IT) and Utrecht University (NL) under Stefano Baratella and Jaap van Oosten further solidify his strong foundation in the field.

We very welcome Matteo as he will be contributing his expertise to the STENDHAL project. He will focus on the syntax and categorical semantics of spatial-temporal logics within the project. His background in categorical logic and type theory makes him uniquely qualified to address these complexities.
