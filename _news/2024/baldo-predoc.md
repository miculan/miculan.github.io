We are happy to welcome [Massimiliano Baldo](https://baldomassimiliano.com/) in our research group as "pre-doc" research fellow.

Massimiliano comes from the University of Padova, where he has completed his MSc in Computer Science under the supervision of Tullio Vardanega. 
His research interests and expertise in programming languages, distributed systems, cloud computing and IoT will be very useful for the _Securing Containers (SecCo)_ project, funded by NRRP [SERICS](https://serics.eu/services/spoke-4-sicurezza-sistemi-operativi-virtualizzazione/) within the NGEU.
