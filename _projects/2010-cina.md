Project CINA was about *Compositionality, Interaction, Negotiation, Autonomicity for the future ICT society*. 

This project dealt with issues related to the development and management of open-ended IT systems consisting of heterogeneous, highly parallel, massively distributed components with complex interactions and behaviours, and with autonomy in terms of individual behaviour, objectives and decision-making. We aimed to a coherent, integrated set of languages, methods and tools to build systems that can operate in open-ended, unpredictable environments while adapting to changing contexts or requirements, and that behave reliably and are able to cope with failures and attacks.
