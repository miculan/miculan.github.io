The subject of this project was Computer-Assisted Formal Reasoning, an area of vital concern for industry. Our research aimed to develop the technology of formal reasoning based on Type Theory. In past EU projects (ESPRIT BRA and Working Group) we made significant progress in developing type theory and tools for formal reasoning. These have been successfully used in applications, but have been limited by lack of adequate support for some aspects of formal reasoning.

This was my first EU-funded project. Lots of interesting workshops and meetings. Nice memories.
