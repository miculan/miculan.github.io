EuroProofNet, the *European Research Network on Formal Proofs*, is the European research network on digital proofs. EuroProofNet aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of proof systems.
This action aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of proof systems and make formal proofs enter a new era. For the first time, it gathers all the developers and users of proof systems in Europe. To make the proofs exchangeable, they will express, in a common logical framework, the logical foundations of their systems and develop tools for inter-translation of the proofs developed in individual systems to and from this common logical framework.

This action was the continuation of the decades-long sequence of EU-funded projects "TYPES", about type theory and proof assistants.
