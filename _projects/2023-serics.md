[SEcurity and Rights In the CyberSpace (SERICS)](https://serics.eu) is a PNRR-funded foundation for the research in Cybersecurity. It gathers 11 universities, 7 research centers and 6 companies; it will fund 27 research projects, for more than 100M€.

I adhere to this foundation, and more precisely to the spoke *Software and Platform Security*, based at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice. 
Moreover, I participate to the design and proposal of the project Securing Containers (SecCo).

Soon we will open new positions (research fellowships, PhD, and alike), so, if you are interested in working on advanced cybersecurity topics, stay tuned and get in touch!
