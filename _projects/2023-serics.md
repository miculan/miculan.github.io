[SEcurity and Rights In the CyberSpace (SERICS)](https://www.cybersecurity360.it/news/progetto-serics-sostenere-la-ricerca-in-cyber-security-per-irrobustire-il-sistema-paese/) is a PNRR-funded foundation for the research in Cybersecurity. It gathers 11 universities, 7 research centers and 6 companies; it will fund 27 research projects, for more than 100M€.

I adhere to this foundation, and more precisely to the spoke *Software and Platform Security*, based at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice. 
Moreover, I have participated to the definition of one of the projects (SECCO).

Soon we will open new positions (research fellowships, PhD, and alike), so, if you are interested in working on advanced cybersecurity topics, stay tuned and get in touch!
