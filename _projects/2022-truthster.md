TRUTHSTER aims to support media professionals by providing them with an easy tool for certifying the creation of media content requiring the interaction with a user (e.g. an interview) and generating semi-automated legal disclaimers and licenses. We use a decentralized infrastructure (the Alastria DLT) as a trusted platform for guaranteeing «proof of validity» and ownership for professional media content creators.

In this project I work on the design and implementation of the protocols, applications and interactions with the Alastria DLT.
