I have taught courses on many subjects, and not only in scientific faculties; in fact, Computer Science is intrinsically multidisciplinary, and hence interacting with students and colleagues from different fields is a valuable and inspiring experience. 

I have created _ab nihilo_ several courses, such as *Distributed Systems*, *Computer Network Security*, *Concurrency theory*, *Languages and Models for Global Computing*.
Currently I am the coordinator of the [Cybersecurity](https://www.dmif.uniud.it/en/master/computer-science/cybersecurity/) track within the Master Degree in Computer Science.
