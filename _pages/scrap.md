It is difficult to resume 30 years of research in a single page. But if I had to resume in few words, I would say this:

I like machines in general, and computer in particular. Because they are stupid. 
Compared to the complexity of other subjects, especially humans, they are simple. 
Biological systems, especially humans, are the result of a random-based selection-driven evolution. They are not the result of a rational, planned design.
Instead, systems and computers are designed by humans. And this is an advantage we must be aware of and not give up. Because if we design them, we are in a position to understand, control and determine their behavior. The converse is not true. Never will be.

From this point, my research follows.
