Associate Professor of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.dmif.uniud.it">DMIF</a>, <a href="https://www.uniud.it">University of Udine</a>. <small>(Qualified as full professor since March 2018)</small>

This webpage collects some information about my research, including my [publications](/publications/), the [projects](/projects/) I am involved in, and my [teaching](/teaching/) and [professional](/services/) activities.

Currently, I am mostly interested in security issues of distributed, component-based and *smart* systems, whose overall behavior is determined by the interaction of many heterogeneous entities.
To this end, I am applying formal methods (possibly with a pinch of Machine Learning) to define new models, languages, methodologies and techniques for the formalisation, verification and certification of security properties of these systems.
<br/>If this sounds interesting to you too, [drop me a note](mailto:marino.miculan@uniud.it).

[I am a *horizontal* scientist, not vertical: I prefer to range over many different subjects, finding connections between apparently distant subjects.]::
Besides, I know one or two things about
process calculi,
distributed ledgers,
session types,
category theory and logic, 
bigraphs, 
coalgebras, 
structured operational semantics, 
nominal sets, 
systems biology, 
type theory, 
logical frameworks,
proof assistants.
(In a sense, I am a *horizontal* researcher.)

I founded and currently lead the [Models and Applications of Distributed Systems](https://mads.uniud.it) laboratory, the Udine node of the [CINI National CyberSecurity laboratory](https://cybersecnatlab.it), and the [MadrHacks](https://www.madrhacks.org), the ethical hacking team of the University of Udine.<br/>
I have the fortune to work with great [people](/group/).
