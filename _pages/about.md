Associate Professor of Computer Science and Deputy Head at <a href="https://www.dmif.uniud.it">Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics</a> of the <a href="https://www.uniud.it">University of Udine</a>,
with a second affiliation at the <a href="https://www.unive.it/pag/28183">Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics</a> of the <a href="https://www.unive.it">Ca' Foscari University of Venice</a>.
<small>(Qualified to Full Professor since March 2018.)</small>

This website collects some information about my [research](/research/), including my [publications](/publications/), the scientific [projects](/projects/) and [events](/events/) I am involved in, my [teaching](/teaching/) activities and academic [services](/services/).

Currently, I am mostly interested in security issues of distributed, component-based and *smart* systems, whose overall behavior is determined by the interaction of many heterogeneous entities.
To this end, I am applying formal methods (possibly with a pinch of Machine Learning) to define new models, languages, methodologies and techniques for the formalisation, verification and certification of security properties of these systems.
<br/>If this sounds interesting to you too, [drop me a note](mailto:marino.miculan@uniud.it).

Besides, I know something about
type theory,
proof assistants,
logical frameworks,
nominal sets, 
category theory and logic, 
process calculi,
coalgebras, 
structured operational semantics, 
session types,
bigraphs, 
systems biology, 
distributed ledgers.
(In a sense, I am a *horizontal* researcher.)

I founded and currently lead the [Models and Applications of Distributed Systems](https://mads.uniud.it) laboratory, the Udine node of the [CINI National CyberSecurity laboratory](https://cybersecnatlab.it), and the [MadrHacks](https://www.madrhacks.org), the ethical hacking team of the University of Udine.<br/>
I have the fortune to work with great [people](/group/).
