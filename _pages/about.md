This webpage collects some information about my research, including my [publications](/publications/), the [projects](/projects/) I am involved in, and my [teaching](/teaching/) and [professional](/services/) activities.
I lead the [Models and Applications of Distributed Systems](https://mads.uniud.it) lab, and the CyberSecurity lab.
I have the fortune to work with a great [research group](/group/).

[I am a *horizontal* scientist, rather than vertical. I prefer to range over many different subjects, finding connections between apparently distant subjects.]::
I know one or two things about
process calculi,
distributed ledgers,
session types,
category theory and logic, 
bigraphs, 
coalgebras, 
structured operational semantics, 
nominal sets, 
systems biology, 
type theory, 
logical frameworks,
proof assistants.

Currently, I am mostly interested in security aspects of distributed, component-based and *smart* systems, for which I use and develop semantic models, formal methods and domain specific languages.<br/>
If these are your interests too, drop me a note.
