I am Full Professor of Computer Science at the [Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics](https://www.dmif.uniud.it) of the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it), with a second affiliation at the [Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics](https://www.unive.it/pag/28183) of the [Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it).

This website collects some information about my current and past [research](/research/), including my [publications](/publications/), the scientific [projects](/projects/) I am involved in, my academic [services](/services/) and my [teaching](/teaching/) activities.

My [current research](/research/) focuses on ensuring the security and trustworthiness of distributed, component-based, and _smart_ systems. These interconnected systems involve numerous heterogeneous components, which makes analyzing their behavior a complex challenge. To address this, I leverage [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) to develop novel models, languages, methodologies, and verification techniques to specify, analyze, and ensure the security and trustworthiness of these systems. 
If this sounds interesting to you, [feel free to reach out](mailto:marino.miculan@uniud.it).


Besides, I know something about
[type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory),
[proof assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant),
[logical frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_framework),
[nominal sets](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nominal+set), 
[category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) and [categorical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_logic), 
[process calculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus),
[coalgebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-coalgebra), 
[semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)), 
[session types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_type),
[bigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigraph), 
[distributed ledgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger).

I founded and currently lead the [Models and Applications of Distributed Systems](https://mads.uniud.it) laboratory, the Udine node of the [CINI National CyberSecurity laboratory](https://cybersecnatlab.it), and the [MadrHacks](https://www.madrhacks.org), the ethical hacking team of the University of Udine.  
I have the fortune to work with great [people](/group/).
