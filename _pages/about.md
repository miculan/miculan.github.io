This webpage collects some information about my research, including my [publications](/publications/), the [projects](/projects/) I am involved in, and my [teaching](/teaching/) and [professional](/services/) activities.
I lead the [Models and Applications of Distributed Systems](https://mads.uniud.it) laboratory.
I have also the fortune to work with a great [research group](/group/).

[I am a *horizontal* scientist, rather than vertical. I prefer to range over many different subjects, finding connections between apparently distant subjects.]::
I know one or two things about
process calculi,
distributed ledgers,
session types,
category theory and logic, 
bigraphs, 
coalgebras, 
structured operational semantics, 
nominal sets, 
systems biology, 
type theory, 
logical frameworks,
proof assistants.

Currently, I am mostly interested in formal methods and languages for distributed, component-based and *smart* systems, with a focus on system and network security.  If these are your interests too, drop me a note.
